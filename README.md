##### The actually useful 1-line-of-code iOS app by [Douglas Heriot](http://douglasheriot.com/)

Instantly turns your iOS device brightness up all the way, *without leaving your home screen*. Doesn’t even have any interface or nibs or xibs or even an event loop!

It’s (basically) just **1 line** of code (see [main.m]((https://github.com/DouglasHeriot/All-the-Way/blob/master/All+the+Way/main.m))

    [UIScreen mainScreen].brightness = 1.0;
